Green's Theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve **C** to a double integral over the plane region **D** bounded by **C**:

$$
\oint_C (P \, dx + Q \, dy) = \iint_D \left( \frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x} - \frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} \\right) dx \, dy
$$

It has applications in linear algebra, electromagnetism, and fluid dynamics.
